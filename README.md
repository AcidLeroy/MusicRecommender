#Music Recommender

In this project we have included several scripts that can be run for both collaborative filtering and content based filtering. 
We have successfully implemented the collaborative filtering, but didn't have much luck with the content filtering due to the fact
that the dense matrix was extremely large. This code was tested using [the million song data base](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/).
